        <h2>Curatorial Text</h2>
        <p>
            For this exhibition, I’m exploring how net art delves into themes of fear, identity, and technology. All of
            these pieces reveal something unsettling about how the internet and digital tech are reshaping who we are.
            Whether it's our bodies being reduced to data or our identities being twisted and controlled, these works
            challenge us to rethink what it really means to be human in an increasingly digital world. They push us to
            confront the eerie intersection between technology and the self, where nothing feels quite real anymore.

            <h3>Bodies© INCorporated (1996)</h3>
            <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Victoria Vesna</p>
            <p>
                This piece shows how our bodies can get turned into data in the digital world. It's a creepy idea
                because it feels like we could lose ourselves to technology.

            <h3>The Dollie Clone Series (1995-1998)</h3>
            <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Lynn Hershman Leeson</p>
            <p>
                This series is about digital clones of people. It's kind of scary because it plays with the idea of
                being replaced or watched by your own digital double.

            <h3>My Boyfriend Came Back From the War (1996)</h3>
            <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Olia Lialina</p>
            <p>
                This one’s an interactive story about someone’s partner coming back from war, but changed and distant.
                It’s about the horror of someone coming back unrecognizable, like they’re not the same person anymore.

            <h3>FloodNet (1998)</h3>
            <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Electronic Disturbance Theater</p>
            <p>
                FloodNet was a piece of art and also a tool for online protests. It let people send a bunch of useless
                messages to a website all at once, making it slow down and fill up with random words. It was like a
                virtual sit-in. It was made to help the Zapatistas, a Mexican activist group, and was all about raising
                awareness for injustice online.

            <h3>The Web Stalker (1997)</h3>
            <p><strong>Artist:</strong> I/O/D (Matthew Fuller, Colin Green, Simon Pope)</p>
            <p>
                The Web Stalker was a weird, artist-made browser that didn’t follow the usual way of browsing the web.
                Instead of showing images or fancy layouts, it let users focus only on the text and connections between
                different web pages. It was a critique of the mainstream browsers and showed how we should think beyond
                just what we see on the surface.
